    "##### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "For all 2.2 section.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Determining the Size of the Dataset**:\n",
    "   - our dataset has a considerable size with **814,788 instances** and **51 features** that provide detailed attributes or properties of each instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Previewing the Data**:\n",
    "   - We have displayed the first few entries of the dataset to get an initial understanding of the data's structure and content. This is like reading the first page of a book to get a sense of the story.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Assessing Data Completeness**:\n",
    "   - The dataset's informational output revealed that certain features have missing values. For example, 'LANE_CNT' has many missing values, whereas 'CRASH_RECORD_ID' is complete. This insight is crucial for understanding which features are fully observed and which may require data imputation or cleaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Visualizing Feature Distributions**:\n",
    "   - We have created a series of plots to visualize the distribution of various features. These plots help us understand the frequency and pattern of different attributes. For example, the 'POSTED_SPEED_LIMIT' plot suggests most data points cluster around specific speed limits (30), while the 'LANE_CNT' plot indicates a right-skewed distribution, meaning lower lane counts are more common.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Exploring Categorical Features**:\n",
    "   - For categorical data, We have smartly chosen to remove features with high cardinality to simplify the analysis. Then, we have visualized the remaining categorical features in a grid of plots, displaying the relative frequency of each category within these features. These visualizations help to quickly grasp which categories are most or least common.\n",

    "# Cloudiness in Illinois\n",
    "\n",
    "Illinois has never been considered the Sunshine State. However, cities in Illinois are considered in the middle ranks of U.S. cities in terms of cloudiness. They are neither as sunny as Las Vegas nor as cloudy as Seattle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a breakdown of the number of days with clear, partly cloudy, and cloudy skies for select cities in Illinois with long-term observations. The daily average sky cover, based on hourly weather observations of cloud types and coverage (in tenths), is classified into three classes:\n",
    "- Clear: daily average sky cover ranging from 0 to 3 tenths\n",
    "- Partly cloudy: daily average sky cover from 4 to 6 tenths\n",
    "- Cloudy: daily average sky cover from 7 to 10 tenths\n",
    "\n",
    "## Annual Average Number of Days by City\n",
    "\n",
    "| City       | Clear | Partly Cloudy | Cloudy |\n",
    "|------------|-------|----------------|--------|\n",
    "| Cairo      | 113   | 104            | 149    |\n",
    "| Chicago    | 84    | 105            | 176    |\n",
    "| Moline     | 101   | 100            | 164    |\n",
    "| Peoria     | 95    | 97             | 172    |\n",

    "You can also visit the [National Centers for Environmental Information](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/) for more information on cloudiness of U.S. cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "but as you can see in our dataset the Clear weather is about 78.5% of our data which means most of the accident happened in clear way and we can see from the report that there are only 84 days with clear weather condition in chicago, so this means that people maybe care more about driving in Cloudy day so there are less accident happening with this condition.\n",
